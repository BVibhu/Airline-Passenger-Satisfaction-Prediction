This project focusses on deriving insights from the customer satisfaction dataset inorder to understand the key attributes that contribute most to customer satisfaction.

Motivation for this project:

1. Airlines leave upto 1.4B USD in revenue on the table by failing to increase their customer satisfaction (source: Forrester)
2. It takes almost 200K USD per year for a company of size 1000 and $100 in revenue to run a NPS program (source: CustomerGauge)

This project has 3 primary objectives:

1) Predict Customer Satisfaction
2) Identify features that contribute most to customer satisfaction
3) Use semi-supervised learning to create labels for data

Expected Outcome:

1) Increased Revenue (upto USD 1.4B)
2) Cost savings in running NPS programs
3) Improved brand image and perception


Customer satisfaction is of utmost importance for airlines for several reasons:

1) Customer Loyalty: Airlines want to build a loyal customer base who choose to fly with them repeatedly. Customers who are satisfied with their experience are more likely to choose the same airline in the future, leading to increased revenue for the airline.

2) Reputation: Airlines rely heavily on their reputation, which is built on the experiences of their customers. Satisfied customers are more likely to spread positive word-of-mouth, leading to more customers and a better reputation. On the other hand, dissatisfied customers can harm the airline's reputation, leading to a decrease in business.

3) Competitive Advantage: Airlines operate in a highly competitive industry, and customer satisfaction is one of the key factors that sets them apart from their competitors. Airlines that prioritize customer satisfaction can gain a competitive advantage, attracting more customers and generating more revenue.

4) Revenue: Satisfied customers are more likely to spend more money on ancillary products and services offered by the airline, such as seat upgrades, in-flight meals, and baggage fees. In addition, they are more likely to return for future flights, leading to increased revenue for the airline.

5) Compliance: Airlines are subject to a variety of regulations and standards, including safety regulations and customer service standards. Meeting these standards is important for compliance, and satisfied customers are more likely to report positive feedback to regulatory authorities.
